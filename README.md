How many bikes should a person own?

That’s an easy question, N+1. The right number of bikes to own is always the current number plus another.

Currently I own 6.5 bikes:
- Carbon Fiber road bike
- Vintage 12spd Steel road bike
- modern raw Steel road bike
- Carbon Fiber Mountain bike
- Aluminum road bike
- Steel Touring-esque road bike
- half a hardtail mtb

I can only ride one bike at a time after all, so how can I justify this?

Put simply, I can’t, however I make peace with it and convince my parents that it’s okay by several reasons:
- The carbon road bike was a gift - so I can’t sell it, it also fits my dad who is free to ride it whenever he likes
- The aluminum road bike is on the East Coast for college
- Hardtail mtb is not worth selling and is join “owned” with my father (So my numbers look better) Good spare bike for anyone visiting
- Vintage Steel bike is going to be sold as it is actually too small for me

My latest bike build, the raw steel road bike was built to replace my vintage steel bike and my carbon bike. It does a pretty good job at this, however it has some quirks from running all modern gear on a 1970’s frame. It also has no paint, so rusts extremely easily. This bike suffers from 2 things: It can’t accommodate tires wider than 28mm and doesn;t have rack mounts or clearance for fenders. This bike would also not be good for multi-day rides due to the raw steel. 

Yep you read that right -- time for another bike. This bike will seek to fill the multi-day/wet weather bike category. I have no parts except for some 700cx32 white wall tires for this build and a Velo orange touring leather saddle.

Here were my ideal requirements:
- 25” or larger frame
- Rack on back
- Steel Frame
- 700c wheels
- longer wheelbase
- indexed shifting
- Triple chainrings
- Front fender or rack mounts
- parts easily salvageable to another frame if a better one is found
- Total cost <$350 USD

### Finding the frame

Ideally I’d be building myself a full on touring bike. The first thing to locate was the bike frame. After a few weeks of lurking on Craigslist, I found what I believe to be a 1980s Bridgestone 400. The frame is triple-butted 531 and was 25” (the same size as the other steel bike that I built!). Unfortunately the bike had been painted a nasty green color, but looked to be in good shape other than that! It accommodates 700c wheels, had a 68mm BB shell and the brake mounts were made for modern mounts. For $30 it seemed like a worthwhile purchase. 

Shortcomings of the frame:
- Only fender mounts (rack on back with adapters)
- direct mount brakes
- paint quality and color

The frame dictates much of the rest of the build. Mainly the brake choice. Most touring bikes use canti brakes (easier to fit fenders) and have more rack mounting options. This means I will probably just build this bike up with a rear rack and keep my eyes peeled for a more appropriate frame.

### Finding the other frame / what parts to use
Touring bikes come in quite a variety, it seems that the most distinguishable thing is the choice of handlebars and shifters. Some people opt for drop bar touring bikes with bar end shifters, some for mtb shifters on flat or modified drops. Other’s use alternative bars that are a combo of multiple bars.

Seeing as I haven’t done any bike touring, I didn’t want to full send into a super specialized and expensive setup. I also liked the idea of being able to use the bike as a road bike as needed. I planned to use drop bars with bar-end shifters as people online hailed their reliability. One problem I had with this was that my back gets tight riding my road bike with drops for any long period of time. I think this is due to a weak core and the required bend while riding a road bike. I hoped to have a more upright position on this bike. Several hours of research later I decided that I wanted some gravel short drop flared bars. I’m hoping this will make riding in the drops and tops more comfortable and may even use a steerer extender to raise the handlebars. THis is what I ended up with:

So what of the rest of the bike? My last build summed up to almost $300 for a used sram force/rival groupset. I don’t want to spend that much on this one. Almost everyone knows that buying individual bike parts is the quickest way to go over budget. I quickly browsed for any bikes that I could salvage parts off of on craigslist. Unfortunately nothing jumped out. 
Fast forward a week later, I’m swamped with projects from my online classes and I take break to browse facebook marketplace. The first icon: **Bianchi Eros road bike $100** posted 2 minutes ago. Years of combing used marketplaces told me this was a steal -- full campy parts and no damage. Unfortunately the frame was ~50cm, however that didn’t matter as I already had my frame. Unfortunately it was an hour away driving, I texted them anyway and decided that it was worth the drive for all of these parts. Around an hour later I owned another bike! It had a triple crank and Campy Mirage shifters that I thought would work on flared drop bars.

Unfortunately my extremely busy term was still finishing up and I had to table this project.

### Stripping the Bianchi
You would think by now I would be able to tear a frame down in an hour. Sadly, I’ve learned that that is never the case. The  process was not bad, the pedals, seatpost, crank, shifters, brakes, handlebars, quill, and cables came right off. Unfortunately, I was not having any luck with the headset cups and the bottom bracket, two pieces I definitely needed for the other frame. 

One dead blow and a lot of penetrating oil later, I managed to pound out the headset cups. Unfortunately the BB wouldn’t budge. I decided this was one of those times to have the right tool, I ordered the correct BB wrench on ebay for $10. In hindsight, It might have been wise to buy a new square taper BB but this one was the original and matched all the other parts on the bike.
ADDDD

### Painting the Bridgestone frame
Since I wasn’t sure that I’d like or even fit the bike, I decided that I would rattle-can it instead of stripping it and getting it powder coated. I was a little nervous, but it couldn’t be worse than the green it was. I purchased some Rustoleum metallic blue spray paint to put over the green.

I spent much too long reading how to spray paint bikes and ended up psyching myself out. Think trying to figure out the right temperature to paint, whether to wet sand between coats, wait a specific time for it to dry, clear coat overtop etc. Luckily I was talked out of this! I lightly sanded the frame for adhesion and masked out the bits I didn’t want paint in. 

Here are some progress shots:

We shall see how well this holds up, I’ve let it cure for ~48 hours.

### Operation Headset
Getting the headset our of the Bianchi frame proved to be a real pain. However after some time with the dead blow, some PB-Blaster and a well positioned socket (to pound out the cups) I was able to remove the headset cups.
Installing the headset proved to be nearly as difficult. The first problem was that the fork on the bridgestone actually required a different size of crown race. I ended up putting my crown race into a mini-lathe and using a dremel to round out the center to 26.8mm from 26.2mm. This was albeit a janky process, however after some careful tapping with a screwdriver I was able to seat the crown race onto the fork. I also don’t have the proper tools to seat the cups into the steerer. I achieved this by using a threaded rod and some washers. This got me most of the way there but I had to pull out the trusty dead blow to tap the cups completely flush.

Here is the assembled fork without the locknut. As you can see there aren’t many threads showing, this is a little concerning but when attached, it seems to be solid!of course I was anxious and threw the handlebars and wheels on to see what this will look like!

### Bottom Bracket struggles
The bottom bracket was severely rusted into the bianchi frame.

My first attempt at removing the bottom bracket involved a 3d printed tool that fit around the bottom bracket. This proved the plastic proved to be too soft to get either side of the bracket to move. A search on ebay later I ordered a used version of the tool I needed for this specific bottom bracket. 

This tool arrived and I tried using it with just a hand holding the frame in place with my feet. Once again, nothing budged. Another week passed  and I 3d printed a part to hold the tool onto the frame so I could use a pipe for more leverage -this also was ineffective. At this point I was searching for other bottom brackets to buy. I decided to give it another try, with a longer pipe, and an extra person to hold the frame down while loosening it. To my surprise it actually started bending the tool! Luckily we decided to try the other side of the bearing then and it actually cracked loose! After removing one side we went back to the other side and managed to get it loose.

This thing was greasy and rusty -- I took a wire wheel to it and cleaned it up. It seemed to still be running smooth so I threaded it right into the next frame. It went without a hitch.

##### Final thoughts
- The paint job on this will not last
- The brake pads need replacing/barely have clearance
- Fenders might be a very tight fit
- Frame size is large enough for me!
- Double-wrapping handlebars is hard

##### The next bike….
I’m still looking for a bike that would be a better touring bike:
- Something with a real paint job
- Something with rack AND fender mounts
- Something with cantilever brakes
